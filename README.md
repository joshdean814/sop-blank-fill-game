### Overview
JavaScript(JS) localhost game for MadLibs style fill-in-the-blanks story generation. Meant for younger students to practice JS on, using this project as a starter template. Implementation only needs basic JS knowledge to be completed, and is limited to only one file.

### File Purposes:

```fill-student.js``` the **only** file that should be altered. All other files are readonly (do not change). This file handles anything related to the fill event in the project.

```game-home.html``` core HTML for the project, provides basic structure for JavaScript to work with. Reference this to understand any DOM elements.

```game-home.js``` main JS file preparing many of the forms and styles leading up to a fill event.

```styles.css``` CSS file providing the base styles and colors for the whole project.

```texts.js``` basic JS file storing the prompt text and related data.

```/img``` image directory storing background image.

### Setup
Open ```game-home.html``` and use the Live Server plugin to view the incomplete game on a browser. Play around with the functionality. What seems to be broken inside the game?

### Implementation
Open ```fill-student.js``` and identify any code replaced with a **// TODO:** comment. These are the important areas to focus on. All of them must be completed for the code to work as intended.

### Hints
- JavaScript will run, even when the code is "broken". Pay close attention to the console to make sure that no error messages are getting printed behind the scenes.
- When a variable is unused in VSCode, it will appear greyed out. Which variables are unused here?

### Solution
The working code file is stored in the ```/solutions``` directory, but do not reference it without permission from a teacher.
