# sop-blank-fill-game
By Josh Dean [u1313908] for Writing 3014 SOP Project

### Overview
JavaScript(JS) localhost game for MadLibs style fill-in-the-blanks story generation. Meant for younger students to practice JS on, using this project as a starter template. Implementation only needs basic JS knowledge to be completed, and is limited to only one file.

### Files to change
The **only** file that should be altered is 'fill-student.js'. All other files are readonly (do not alter them anyway).

### To Start
Open the 'game-home.html' file and use the Live Server plugin to view the incomplete game on a browser.
