### Overview
JavaScript(JS) localhost game for MadLibs style fill-in-the-blanks story generation. Meant for younger students to learn JS from, using this as a starter template. Implementation only needs JS knowledge to be completed, and is limited to only one file.

### Files to change
The ONLY file that should be altered is 'fill-student.js'. All other files are readonly.

### To Start
Open the 'game-home.html' file and use the Live Server plugin to view the incomplete game on a browser.
