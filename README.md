# sop-blank-fill-game
### Use Permission
Created by Josh Dean [u1313908] for Writing 3014 SOP Project. Use without permission or for a nonintended purpose is not allowed.

### Overview
JavaScript(JS) localhost game for MadLibs style fill-in-the-blanks story generation. Meant for younger students to practice JS on, using this project as a starter template. Implementation only needs basic JS knowledge to be completed, and is limited to only one file.

### Files to change
The **only** file that should be altered is 'fill-student.js'. All other files are readonly (do not alter them anyway).

### Setup
Open 'game-home.html' and use the Live Server plugin to view the incomplete game on a browser. Play around with the functionality. What seems to be broken inside the game?

### Implementation
Open 'fill-student.js' and identify any code replaced with a **// TODO:** comment. These are the important areas to focus on. All of them must be completed for the code to work as intended

### Hints
- JavaScript will run, even when the code is "broken". Pay close attention to the console to make sure that no error messages are getting printed behind the scenes.

### Solution
The working code file is stored in the /solutions directory, but do not reference it without permission from a teacher.
